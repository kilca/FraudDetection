Code for fBox algorithm to spot suspicious link behavior

Contact:
   Neil, neilshah@cs.cmu.edu

To run:
   Set datapath and neigs parameters in code/run_srm.m before executing.  datapath should be a binary matlab file with a sparse adjacency matrix.  neigs corresponds to the number of singular vectors to use for reconstructed degree computation.

Algorithm:
	
	Input: graph adjacency matrix A
		decomposition rank k
		threshold T
	
	1) Conduct k-rank partial SVD on A
	2) Compute reconstructed degrees for each node as squared L2 norms of corresponding row vectors in U and V (left and right singular vector matrices)
	3) For each unique true degree value in the dataset, compute the reconstructed degree threshold based on T (i.e. 1 percentile, 2 percentile, 5 percentile)
	4) For all nodes with reconstructed degree below the identified threshold for it's true degree, mark as suspicious (for both left and right singular vectors)
	5) Return suspicious users
